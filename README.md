#  ToW: Nuclear Dawn (S3D Division)

Welcome to the industrial heart of the **Terror of War (ToW)** ecosystem. This mod, developed under the **Scharton 3D (S3D)** brand, focuses on the vertical integration of power, chemistry, and high-tier computing.

##  How to Play

1. Download the latest `.jar` file (e.g., `Tow_nuclear_dawn-v1.0.0.jar`).
2. Drop that file into your Minecraft `mods` folder.
3. Profit.

##  Current Industrial Progress
* **Uranium Path:** From Raw Ore to UO2 Pellets.
* **Silica Path:** From Sand to High-Performance S3D CPUs.
* **Sulfur Path:** Chemical catalysts and explosives.

##  The S3D Assistant says:
> "If you are reading the raw code instead of downloading the JAR, you are doing it wrong. Please utilize the Release tab before I have to recalibrate your safety settings."
